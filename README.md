Data Science Program 

I am a data science learner with a growing interest in applying data-driven solutions within the healthcare domain. I am passionate about using data analysis and machine learning to uncover insights that can support better healthcare decisions and patient outcomes. My goal is to build practical skills through real-world healthcare-focused projects.

Target Role: Junior Data Scientist (Healthcare Focus)
I am currently aiming for a junior data scientist role because it allows me to strengthen my foundations in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning while working with meaningful healthcare data. This role aligns with my learnership stage and my interest in using data to solve real-world healthcare challenges.

Project 1: Exploratory Analysis of Healthcare Patient Data
Analyse an open healthcare dataset to identify trends in patient demographics, common conditions, or treatment outcomes. This project will focus on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualisation using Python.

Project 2: Predicting Patient Readmission Risk
Create a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is likely to be readmitted based on historical healthcare data. This project will introduce feature selection, model evaluation, and ethical considerations when working with sensitive data.

Skills to Grow
Technical Skill: Python for Data Science
Python is a core skill for data science and widely used in healthcare analytics. Improving my Python skills will help me analyse datasets, build predictive models, and automate data workflows.
Soft Skill: Analytical Thinking
Analytical thinking is essential for interpreting healthcare data accurately and asking the right questions. Strengthening this skill will help me draw meaningful conclusions and make data-driven recommendations.

30-Day Goal:
Set up and publish my GitHub Pages portfolio site and complete a small healthcare data analysis project, including basic visualisations and a clear project README.

6-Month Goal:
Build and publish at least two healthcare-focused data science projects on GitHub, improve my machine learning fundamentals, and be prepared to apply for junior data science roles or internships in the healthcare sector.
